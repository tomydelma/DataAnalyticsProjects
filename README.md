## 1. SQL: Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews
- **Objective**: Identify sentiments in product reviews using SQL.
- **How to Accomplish**: Obtain a dataset of reviews (e.g., from Kaggle). Use text functions in SQL to analyze positive and negative keywords. Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into the overall sentiment in the reviews.

## 2. SQL: Customer Churn Analysis
- **Objective**: Detect patterns of churn in customer data.
- **How to Accomplish**: Filter a churn dataset to segment active and inactive customers. Use GROUP BY, JOIN, and WHERE conditions to identify common factors among customers who churned. Utilize simple visualizations to represent the churn rate.

## 3. Power BI: Regional Sales Analysis
- **Objective**: Create an interactive dashboard for sales by region.
- **How to Accomplish**: Obtain a sales dataset with geographical data. In Power BI, create bar charts, maps, and filters to visualize performance by region and product category. Ensure to include key KPIs such as total revenue and percentage growth.

## 4. R: Traffic Accident Analysis
- **Objective**: Use R to analyze factors influencing accidents and visualize geographical data.
- **How to Accomplish**: Import an accident dataset in R and clean the data. Use R graphics to visualize trends and maps to locate accidents by region. Include variables such as accident type and time of day to find correlations and patterns.

## 5. R: Public Health Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Explore relationships in risk factors for certain diseases.
- **How to Accomplish**: Find a health dataset (such as BMI indices and diseases). Use R to perform statistical analyses (correlations and regressions). Generate graphics to visualize relationships between factors and diseases.

## 6. Python: E-commerce Sales Exploratory Analysis
- **Objective**: Generate sales trend analysis in e-commerce with visualizations in Python.
- **How to Accomplish**: Import an e-commerce sales dataset in Python. Use libraries like pandas and matplotlib to clean and explore the data, visualizing trends such as best-selling products and purchasing patterns.

## 7. Python: Image Classification
- **Objective**: Create a machine learning model that classifies images of objects.
- **How to Accomplish**: Obtain a dataset of labeled images (e.g., from Kaggle). Use libraries like TensorFlow or scikit-learn to build a simple CNN model that classifies images into categories. Conduct tests to improve model accuracy.

## 8. Python: Credit Risk Scoring Predictive Model
- **Objective**: Develop a predictive model for credit risk.
- **How to Accomplish**: Import a credit dataset and use scikit-learn in Python to prepare the data. Apply models such as Random Forest or Logistic Regression to predict credit risk. Tune the model to improve accuracy and evaluate results.

## 9. Python: Product Demand Forecasting Predictive Model
- **Objective**: Predict product demand based on time series data.
- **How to Accomplish**: Find a product demand dataset with date information. Use statsmodels or Prophet in Python to build a time series model, evaluating and adjusting the model to optimize prediction accuracy.

## 10. Global Project: Comprehensive Analysis of Customers and Sales
- **Objective**: Combine SQL, Python, R, Power BI, and predictive models in a comprehensive analysis of customers and sales.
- **How to Accomplish**: Use SQL to analyze the customer and sales database. In Python and R, apply predictive models for scoring and forecasting. Finally, visualize results in Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that showcases all key insights.
